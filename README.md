Lastly, fill the Firestore Database with data according to this schema:

```
{

    "background-image": string,
    "card-image": string,
    "description": string,
    "tags": string,
    "title": string,
    "title-image": string,
    "type": "newArrival" / "original" / "recommended" / "trending"
  }
}
```

For example:

```json
{
  "movies": {
    "background-image": "https://i.ibb.co/n1fV2M7/assembled-background.webp",
    "card-image": "https://i.ibb.co/4Ywft66/assembled-card.webphttps://i.ibb.co/4Ywft66/assembled-card.webp",
